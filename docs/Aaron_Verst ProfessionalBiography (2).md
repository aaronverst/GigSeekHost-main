**Project Sought**
I do not have a direct plan or project that I am looking to pursue at this moment. However, I am interested in collaborating with fellow computer scientists to design, build, and launch an intuituve product that can be used by anyone around the world. My previous work experience has taught me a lot about the software development lifecyle and I am excited to have the oppurtunity to implement this knowlege on my own terms with a small team of individuals. 

Key components of my ideal project include:
- A simplistic and logical user interface/experience
- Ease of access for potential consumers (easy instillation and setup)
- A stuctured and dynamic code base
