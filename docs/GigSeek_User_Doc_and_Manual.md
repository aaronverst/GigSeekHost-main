#### Gigseek is a web-based application that serves both venues and performers. It's goal is to streamline the booking process between performers and venues by allowing either party to search for a performer/venue using specific search criteria. This will ultimately replace the unorganized and tedious booking practices used by small-scale performers and venues today.

## 1. Logging In
- #### Upon reaching the landing page, users will be prompted to choose whether they represent a "Perfomer" or a "Venue".
- #### When the user selects their account type, they will then login to the application using their credentials.
## 2. The "Home Page"
- #### Upon logging into their account, users will be presented with GigSeek's home page.
- #### Here, they will have the ability to begin their search for a performer/venue that fits their given criteria.
- #### Using the filter navigation bar located at the top of the "Home Page", users can filter the their feed based off of desired filter criteria.
- #### If a user enters a filter value, their feed will automatically be updated with performers/venues that fit that defined criteria.
- #### Users can then browse their search results and see a limited ammount of information pertaining to each entity on their feed. If the user seeks to learn more about a specific performer/venue, they can click on their profile picture.
## 3. The "Profile Page"
- #### Upon clicking on a profile, users will be directed to the corresponding Performer's/Venue's profile page.
- #### Here, users will have the oppurtunity to browse all public information that pertains to the specific profile. This includes photo libraries, social media accounts, and logistical information.
- #### On this page, the user is presented with two main options. If they would like to pursue the booking process with that specific band/venue, they can slect the "Book Now" button. If not, they can return back to browsing their feed.
## 4. The "Booking Page"
- #### Once the user selects the "Book Now" button, the user will have an option to choose a date or dates that the user would like to book the performer or venue, depending on who is using the application. 
- #### The user can also leave a comment along with the booking request that will be sent to give a description to the venue or performer that they would like. Once the dates and the comment is complete, the request will be sent to the corresponding venue or performer.
- #### The receiving venue or performer will then have an inbox in which they receive these requests. The user can then open up the request and decide to accept or deny the request.
- #### If the request is accepted, then contact information will be shared in between the venue/performer that sent the request along with the receiver. They will then be able to communicate via another way of communication and finalize details.
## 5. The "Support Page"
- #### There will be a support page that users can use to read about FAQs or reach out to one of our representatives about anything! If you have questions concerns, critiques, or even compliments, we are happy to hear about all of them. We would love to hear your feedback! Your opinion is important to us and we are happy to help in any way and make our application as seamless and helpful as it possibly can.


## FAQ

## Will we (the venue and performer) be able to communicate through GigSeek?
- #### Currently, GigSeek will not support a platform to communicate, but instead will share contact information with the venue/performer that you have decided to request if and only if they accept your request and vice versa. Eventually, there might be a way of communicating through the application, but for the time being, there is not an option to do so.

## How will we know how far way a specific performer/venue is from where I'm located?
- #### We will be asking for your location when creating an account, so if there are certain performers/venues near you, that will be updated accordingly to where you are located for the time being. We will provide you with the closest venues that correlate to your likings and preferences. If you would like to search for a specific venue/performer to get in contact with them, the distance between you and them does not matter. You can still send out a booking request regardless, as long as you make it there or they make it there in time!

## How do we cancel performances if need be?
- #### There will be an option to cancel your reservation with that specific venue/performer, but keep in mind: If you decide to cancel your reservation, make sure to communicate that with the venue/performer that you are working with. If you decide to cancel without letting them know or without any reasoning, that could negatively affect you. They do have the option to leave reviews and file complaints if there are repeating occurences of this.

## What if we cannot find the venue/performer that we are looking for?
- #### If you cannot find the venue/performer that you are looking for, then that venue/performer does not exist, or they have not created an account on GigSeek yet. These venues/performers will have to be verified to ensure that they are the real deal, so that can take some time in itself. If you have any recommendations of bands/venues that you would like to see here on GigSeek, let us know through our support tab! We may be able to get them on board to signing up with your help!
