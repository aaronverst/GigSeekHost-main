# Gigseek Project Description
## _Gigseek will be a web-based application that serves venues and performers. Our goal is to streamline the booking process between bands and venues by allowing either party to search for a performer/venue using specific search criteria. Ideally, this will replace the unorganized and tedious booking practices used by small-scale performers/venues today._
